# Hooks Gallery

My first-ever project with React Hooks, a simple image carousel featuring a collection of my early digital artwork from when I was first learning web development.  If you really are that curious about my Photoshop skills, you can take a gander [here](https://drumwolf.github.io/hooks-gallery).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
In the project directory you can run the command `npm start`.  
Then you can view it in the browser here:  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
